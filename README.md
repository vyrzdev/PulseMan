# Package Manager for PulseArc

## This project has been abandoned due to a lack of new commits on the Pulsarc Project.

The purpose of this project was to simplify beatmap downloading for [Pulsarc](https://github.com/PulsarcGame/Pulsarc)
by providing a user-friendly command line interface for browsing and installing maps.
